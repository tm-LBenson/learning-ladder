# Pre-Semester 1: Sophia Courses

## Introduction

Before the official commencement of my college journey, I am taking advantage of [Sophia Learning](https://www.sophia.org/), an online educational platform that offers self-paced courses sponsored by Strayer University. This opportunity allows me to familiarize myself with academic rigour, as well as explore courses that are directly relevant to my future academic path.

Sophia Learning is an accredited online education platform that provides a range of academic courses, from languages and humanities to sciences and business. The platform is designed for flexibility, allowing me to learn at my own pace - a benefit for a self-directed learner like myself.

Each course on Sophia Learning is structured into a series of tutorials, comprising multimedia presentations and assessments. As such, I get to experience a comprehensive learning journey that prepares me well for the academic challenges ahead.

## Uncertainties and Concerns

As I eagerly await the finalization of my enrollment, I must admit that I am faced with a degree of confusion and uncertainty. The process of selecting classes is still somewhat unclear to me - I am unsure of the number of classes I need to enroll in, the number of Sophia courses I should complete, and how my weekly schedule will be structured.

While I am actively choosing Sophia courses that seem relevant and beneficial, I have lingering doubts about whether I am navigating this correctly. As much as I want to seek advice, it feels like my hands are tied until my enrollment is sorted out.

This period of uncertainty, though challenging, is also a reminder of the complexities of navigating a new educational journey. It has prompted me to seek clarity, ask questions, and strive for a deeper understanding of the academic process at Strayer University.

I hope that as my enrollment concludes, I will gain a clearer picture of my academic path, enabling me to make informed decisions about my course selections and overall strategy. I am committed to turning this period of uncertainty into an opportunity for learning and growth.


## Coursework

### ENG 90: Writing Fundamentals

The initial course, Writing Fundamentals ENG 90, was a pre-requisite for ENG 116, titled 'Discover the Writer in You.' This course focused on the basics of English and honed my skills in structuring a 5-paragraph essay.

### Introduction to Business

This course provided an overview of business operations and structures. I was able to finish the course within 3 days, demonstrating my dedication and quick adaptability.

### The Essentials of Managing Conflict & Developing Effective Teams

These were shorter courses which I completed in a matter of hours. They provided valuable insights into team dynamics and conflict management - skills I believe will be beneficial throughout my academic and professional journey.

### Introduction to Python Programming

As a subject I am already comfortable with, I chose this course to enhance my Python programming skills. My background in Python, data structures and algorithms (DSA), object-oriented programming (OOP), and whiteboarding problems greatly facilitated my navigation of the course material. 

The course is structured in a way that it could potentially take several weeks for someone new to Python and programming concepts. However, due to my previous experience and practice, I was able to complete it in a few hours. This accelerated completion time is a testament to my proficiency and the robust foundation I have in Python programming.

A key component of the course was a final project that required application of the concepts learned throughout the course. Leveraging my skills and knowledge, I developed and submitted the project, which is currently awaiting grading.

The experience further bolstered my confidence in Python and solidified my understanding of key concepts. It also provided a valuable opportunity to reflect on how far I've come in my programming journey, as I was able to efficiently complete a course that might have taken a beginner several weeks.

## Strategy Moving Forward

Sophia Learning allows for only two active courses at a time. Currently, I am awaiting the grading of ENG 90 and the Python course. In the meantime, I plan to enroll in more concise courses that don't require a grader's review. My strategy is to utilize this waiting period to amass as much knowledge as possible before the summer semester commences.

## Looking Forward

I look forward to attending on-ground classes at the Arlington Campus one day per quarter. As I await my enrollment to be finalized, I am excited to kick start my journey towards academic excellence.
