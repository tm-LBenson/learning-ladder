# Welcome to my Learning Journal!

Welcome to my Learning Journal! This site documents my journey through college. You'll find my reflections on classes, experiences, and learnings. Take a look around and feel free to follow along on my educational journey.

## Current Posts

- [Pre-Semester 1: Sophia Courses](./Pre-Semester-1/Sophia-Courses.md)

## Coming Soon

I'll be posting content regularly as I progress through my college journey. Upcoming content includes:

- First Day Reflections (Semester 1)
- Regular course reflections (Semester 1)

## Other Notes

- [General Notes](./notes/general-notes.md)

I occasionally jot down notes from my studies in a separate section. These notes may be useful for other students or for those curious about the subjects I'm studying.
