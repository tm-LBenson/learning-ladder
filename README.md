# Learning Ladder
This repository serves as a comprehensive digital learning journal, created using Jekyll, to meticulously document and track my academic progression throughout college. It provides an in-depth chronicle of my growth, experiences, insights, and key takeaways.

## Purpose
The core objective of this Jekyll-powered repository is to consolidate my academic journey in a well-structured, user-friendly format. It aims to assist me in:

1. Keeping a systematic record of my academic progression.
2. Reflecting thoughtfully on my learning process and evolution.
3. Storing critical educational resources and notes for easy retrieval.
4. Consolidating my thoughts, ideas, and experiences for future reference.
5. Offering a transparent account of my journey for others who might draw insights from my experiences or share similar paths.

## Structure
The repository, neatly organized by semesters, optimizes Jekyll's flexibility to provide an easily navigable, intuitive structure. Each semester has separate folders dedicated to each course I undertake. These course folders encapsulate a variety of documents, such as lecture notes, assignments, projects, and my personal reflections on each.

With Jekyll at its backbone, the layout is designed to offer an immersive and engaging experience for anyone interested in following along my academic journey.
