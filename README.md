learning-ladder
This repository serves as a digital learning journal, crafted using Jekyll, to document and track my progression throughout my college journey. It offers a comprehensive view of my academic growth, experiences, reflections, and key learnings.

Purpose
The purpose of this Jekyll-powered repository is to document my academic experiences and learnings in a structured, easy-to-navigate format, assisting me in:

Keeping track of my academic progression.
Reflecting on my learning process.
Storing key educational resources and notes.
Consolidating my thoughts and ideas for future reference.
Providing a transparent record for others who might benefit from my experiences.
Structure
The repository, organized by semesters, leverages the flexibility of Jekyll to create a structured, yet accessible format. Within each semester, there are folders for each course I'm taking. Each course folder contains a variety of files, including lecture notes, assignments, projects, and my reflections on each.


With the use of Jekyll, the layout is designed to be intuitive, providing an immersive experience for anyone interested in my academic journey.
